To Do's Web App

This is simple web app made with HTML5, CSS and Vanilla Javascript, this app allows you to add, edit, delete and mark tasks as completed.
This project was created as practice to help me learn the Javascript fundamentals and improve my web development skills and logic.


FEATURES:

-Add new tasks using the input field or the enter key.
-Mark tasks as completed (with visual feedback).
-Edit existing tasks by clicking on their text.
-Delete Individual tasks using their separe button or delete the whole task list.
-Tasks are automatically saved in Local Storage so they remain even the page is reloaded.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
-HTML5 - For Page structure.
-CSS3 - For Styling, design, and responsive layout.
-JAVASCIPT (ES6+) - For Logic, interactivity and local storage.

HOW IT WORKS:
1.Type a new task in the input field.
2.Click Add or press Enter to add it.
3.Check the box to mark a task as completed.
4.Click the task text to edit it.
5.Click the 🗑️ icon to delete a single task.
6.Click Delete All to remove every task from the list.

WHAT I LEARNED:

While building this project i learned how to:
 - Manipulate the DOM to create, edit and remove elements.
 - Store and retreive data using the browser local storage.
 - Structure my code with reusable functions and event listeners.
 - Debug and read console errors to find logic or syntax issues.
 - Write cleaner code, more readable and well organized code.
 

 MAIN CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED:
  - Understanding how HTMLS, CSS and JS communicate with each other.
  - Fixing layout alignment without breaking the design,
  - Learning how to debug instead of deleting and starting over again.


IMPROVEMENTS I COULD ADD IN THE FUTURE:
 - Add filters to separe tasks (completed / pending tasks).
 - Implement task organization using categories or priorities.
 - Add animations when adding or removing tasks to make the app cuter.
 - Add light/dark mode toggle.
 - Add an API for cloed-based task saving.
